During the cleaning process, VBA Macros were documented to make the future process of report creation as automated as possible. As the orginal source data would be in a consistent form, month on month, using macros would maintain consistency of output for the cleaned data, as well as being a time effiecient process.

## Final monthly report 

The final report took into account all the key metrics in the brief. The exploratory analysis noted that promotions were seen to be having very minor impact on sales and that potentially this was an area for improvement. Also,  that on the 7th April, for an unknown reason there was an error in the data recording. This has been noted to discover what caused the clitch.

### Project development
To further the automation of the report for production on a monthly basis - VBA procedures could be produced developing on from the existing macros.
